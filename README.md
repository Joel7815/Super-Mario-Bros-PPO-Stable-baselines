# Super-Mario-Bros-PPO-Stable-baselines
PPO agent to solve first level of Super Mario Bros using stable baselines

## Introduction
I'm a master student in Computer science and history in the faculty of arts at Lausanne University.Here is the notebook I used to try and complete the first level of Super Mario Bros using the PPO implementation from [Stable Baselines 3 library](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/ppo.html).  I mainly try to replicate succesful implementation from [Viet Nguyen](https://github.com/uvipen/Super-mario-bros-PPO-pytorch/), but was unable to because his implementation of the PPO algorithm is slightly different than the one from stable baselines. After tweaking the parameters of the stable baselines  ppo implementation as well as the learning rate I realized it waas a waste of time and the results were not good. Then I came across a youtube video from [ClarityCoders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxoG0A2QoFs), in this video I realized he changed almost none of the parameters and managed to finished the first level and achieved an average rewards around 3000. One of the most important things he did was in the preprocessing of the environement, he set a maxstep per episode of 20000, according to his experience in solving games with rl he noticed it had an high impact on the results. After doing that I manageed to reach an average reward of 20000 wich was higher than all my previous attempts and was better than another Master thesis work I also inspired myself from.[^1]

## How to use my code
Just make sure to download the requirements.txt file, then you can simply execute code in the jupyter notebook. I used this code in [Gradient Notebooks](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient/notebooks), so if you have problems of compatibilty runnning it on your machine or in colab just make a free account there and it should work. If you want how my best algorithm performs you can just change the path in the notebook.
