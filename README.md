# Super-Mario-Bros-PPO-Stable-baselines
PPO agent to solve first level of Super Mario Bros using stable baselines

## Introduction
Here is the notebook I used to try and complete the first level of Super Mario Bros using the [Stable Baselines 3 library](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/ppo.html). 

## How to use my code
Just make sure to download the requirements.txt file, then you can simply execute code in the jupyter notebook. I used this code in [Gradient Notebooks](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient/notebooks), so if you have problems of compatibilty runnning it on your machine or in colab just make a free account there and it should work. If you want how my best algorithm performs you can just change the path in the notebook.
